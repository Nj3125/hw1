        <h1>The Beauty of New England</h1> 
        <p>When thinking about the regions of the US, one may think at first <br>
           about the of the roar of New York City, the towering Rocky mountains <br>
           that comprise the spine of continental North America, or the scale of the <br>
           adequately named Grand Canyon. However, many people do not know of the many <br>
           wonders found in New England. This website contains a couple of photos I <br>
           have taken while on vacation, all in the areas comprising or surrounding <br>
           New England.
